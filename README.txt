Assignment 8 Extra:

For this assignment, I added UV scaling and offsetting. The way I confirmed the scale
was having different was by having different materials with different scales. Luckily,
scale was easy to compare across multiple different objects. To compare offset, I used
the two flat squares as I could match scale and apply separate offsets to compare them.
